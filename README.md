# Belly Button Plotly Deployment

## Overview of Project
Utilize JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Plotly, and GitHub pages to deploy a data-driven web page to present bacterial type and population findings in human belly buttons!

### Purpose of Project
Your mother told you to wash your belly button. It turns out bacteria can grow in there. In reality we know that various forms of bacteria grow on our bodies. We're part of a vary complex and large ecosystem, very much in spite of whatever anti-bacterial soap you might use.

The purpose of the project this week was to create a web page and multiple visualizations for a large dataset of bacterial variants analyzed and found in people's belly buttons. The bacterial donors were anonymously assigned ID numbers so that review could be done with some basic demographics while not exposing too much identity.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most difficult challenge was working through the JavaScript syntax to get the datasets filtered and organized so that the web page could be dynamically interactive for users. Once this bit of code was built and the functions implemented, the rest was pretty smooth sailing.

## Results
I'm very pleased with the results and the <a href="https://cb19weber.github.io/plotly_deployment/">Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard</a> as well as how much I've been able to grasp JavaScript and create so many wonderful and interactive dashboards, web applications, and visualizations in the past weeks. Coding in JavaScript is actually really fun, and being able to package the front and back-end development skills is awesome.
